Equilibrium uses PHP5, MySQL5, and Apache2.  It is developed for Linux but may work on Macs and Windows with Apache, MySQL, and PHP installed.  An easy way to install all of these on the other platforms is to use XAMPP.

Equilibrium was designed for small groups of people working together, up to about 20 (limited by drop-down boxes of staff names getting inconveniently long).  It may be worth extending Equilibrium to allow multiple teams to use a single copy.
